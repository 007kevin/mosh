	* Version 0.91 released.

	* Startup script support SSH options and aliases (Anders Kaseorg)

	* End use of Path MTU discovery and allow IP fragmentation because,
	e.g., Cisco VPN has MTU of 1200 and does not pass ICMP too-big.

	* Better exception and error handling.

	* Restrict predictive local echo display to long-delay links
	(>60 ms RTT) or for temporarily after a "glitch." Otherwise simply
	show server echos, while maintaining prediction overlay in the
	background in case it is needed.
